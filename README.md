# Sisense

Those script were made for Sisence as task.

Requirements:
1. Being able to run ".sh" scripts
2. Configured AWS CLI (if not the script will be mad at you ;).
3. Use at you own risk.

How to use:
1. Run sudo chmod +x script.sh (example: sudo chmod +x Sisense-Instances_status.sh), so the script is executable. 
2. Then you can run the script (example Sisense-Instances_status.sh -t environment=production -r us-east-1 -i i-aaaab1111222).

*If you are having troubles you can use: -h for help*
